It is definitely one of the nicest Westin hotels i have stayed in Asia. The lobby is on the 6th floor and have a good view of the city. The associate were pretty friendly. I was given a good room but the view was slightly disappointing. Evening Cocktail at the club lounge was pretty decent and breakfast spread was pretty good as well. The only down side was the water of the swimming pool was too cold and i did not really get the chance to stay in the water for too long.\\nAll in all, it is definitely a hotel i will recommend to my friends if they will like a hotel just a stone's throw away from the famous Lau Pa Sat (their satay are so delicious) and a 10 minutes walk from Marina Bay Sands. It is also a hotel suitable for business meetings as well, unlike the Marriott Tang Plaza (which is too noisy).\", 'rating': '4'}), '696808594': defaultdict(None, {'review_url': 'https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1638637-r696808594-Bintan_Resort_Ferries-Singapore.html', 'review_date': '8 August 2019', 'experience_date': '2019-08', 'review_title': 'Comfortable Ferry Ride', 'review_type': 'attraction', 'text': 'Took this ferry 4 times in the space of 3 days and find the ride comfortable except for the bumpy waters that cannot be controlled.
