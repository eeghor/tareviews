      "defaultdict(None, {'address': 'st. kilda road, melbourne, victoria 3001, australia', 'about': 'Visit the Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne\\'s most iconic landmark, where Victorians have been coming since 1934 to honour the service and sacrifice of Australian men and women in war and peacekeeping. Enter the Shrine and experience the quiet solitude of the Sanctuary where hundreds of thousands pay their respects each year. All visitors are invited to participate in a Remembrance Ceremony featuring the Ray of Light re-enactment. Surrounded by the Shrine Reserve, the Shrine is elevated, overlooking the city of Melbourne within 13 hectares of beautiful parkland. Enjoy stunning views of the Reserve and many of Melbourne\\'s landmarks from the balcony of the Shrine. Explore the monuments and memorials throughout the Reserve, including the Gallipoli Memorial, as well as the many remembrance trees dedicated to Victorian service units from the Boer War onwards. The Eternal Flame on the Second World War Forecourt symbolises eternal life for those who have served. The Ray of Light ceremony is central to the experience of the Shrine of Remembrance. A ray of natural sunlight passes through an aperture in the ceiling of the Sanctuary and falls onto the Stone of Remembrance over the word \"love\" at precisely 11.00 am on 11 November each year. This is the moment when the armistice was signed in 1918 marking the end of hostilities in the First World War. The ceremony is now reproduced every half hour using electric light to allow all visitors to the Shrine to experience it. The Shrine also has an extensive permanent and temporary exhibition space. The Galleries of Remembrance is a $45 million Victorian Government redevelopment that utilises 1,600 square metres of undercroft space beneath the Shrine. Over 850 objects illustrate the experiences of Australians at war and in peacekeeping operations, from Pre-Federation to the present day, with a particular focus on individual and unit stories of Victorian service and sacrifice. A highlight of the exhibition is the SS Devanha lifeboat, a Gallipoli landing boat on loan from the collection of the Australian War Memorial. The Devanha carried soldiers of the 12th Battalion and the 3rd Field Ambulance into Anzac Cove on the morning of 25 April 1915.'})\n",

      "text:  This is an impressive building with a huge subterranean labyrinth of exhibits covering Australia's long involvement in wars and peace keeping since the 1800's. Definitely walk to the top and view the black stone commemorating the end of WWI. Then make your way down to the visitor center and exhibit area and spend time reviewing Australia's involvement and huge sacrifices during our major contemporary wars plus it's contribution to peacekeeping efforts around the world. Very informative.\n",

      "The weather was excellent and meant that going up stairs and looking out from the balcony was spectacular. The exhibits are interesting and informative.\n",

There is a lift to inside the building, but could not find one to the top level. Top level provided a great view of the city scape. Easy walk then to the botanical gardens and government house\n",
