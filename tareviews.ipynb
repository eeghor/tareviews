We were disappointed in our visit as some galleries (the aboriginal displays) were closed as was the cafe where we had expected to have lunch. This building combines displays of natural history, art work, and Cyclone Tracy. Visitors follow sloped walkways to see the displays in that order.\\n\\nThe natural history exhibit displays included shells/molluscs, stuffed birds (parrots, cockatoos, raptors), scorpions, widow spiders, moths and butterflies, mounted centipedes, various fish (catfisn, sharks, sawfish), box jelly fish, and even some skeletons of pre-historic animals. The smaller items were displayed in separate clear 5 foot cases with all items clearly labelled and identified; general information about each species was attached to these cases. In addition, there was also a display of gemstones. The item that was given the biggest space was the stuffed croc called, \"Sweetheart\". It had been 80-90 years old when its rescuers had actually drowned it. There was a video where visitors stood and watched this failed rescue attempt.\\n\\nThe art gallery had Frank Gohier\\'s varied work on display. I enjoyed listening to the video interview in which he provides information about himself and his art style - its form and purpose - more than I did looking at his works in the enormous amount of space the gallery gave to showing his works. His posters made a political statement using comic book type vivid colors and illustrations. A different display for sure!\\n\\nCyclone Tracy gallery display was packed into a smaller gallery. Visitors can hear the wind howling before they actually are in the gallery. A video is playing made by a news team - so common now a days - which showed the destruction of Darwin homes, shops, ships, wharves, and office buildings. Visitors can choose to enter a darkened broom closet where they hear the howling wind of a cyclone and the scraping of the tin roofs being shoved along the roads. Stay as long as you like in this room. There was also a wall display of photos showing the damage done in various areas of Darwin - rubble strewn in front yards, downed electrical wires on roads, uprooted trees, roofless homes, etc. I enjoyed listening to the personal stories of those who had experienced this cyclone. I also enjoyed reading about the new building laws for homes that resulted from their cyclone experience and photos to show the difference in building styles. I was unsure why there were displays of residential living rooms from the 1970\\'s with the expected old models of TV and worn couches in them.\\n\\nWe stayed 1 1/2 hours after which we caught the 12:55 Hop on Hop Off bus at the Art Gallery\\'s front door to visit the Defence of Darwin display. It takes the HOHO bus only 15 minutes to reach this Art Gallery from its downtown Stop 1 at the Visitor\\'s Center. Visitors wanting to see the Botanic Gardens should do that before getting off at the Art Gallery otherwise they will have to ride the entire route to Stop 1 where the bus repeats its route to the Botanic Garden.', 'by_user': 'retireeVancouver', 'rating': 3.0, 'date_of_experience': '02/2018', 'date_of_writing': '26/03/2018'}\n",
